# SortFile

A program that sorts a very large text file (assume that the data from the file does not fit in RAM). The sorting routine must be in a separate assembly.
Addition:
- Sorting should work with Unicode / MBCS / UTF-16 text
- A generator of corresponding text files must be written separately.
- Demonstration of work must take place on a file of at least 1 GB.
